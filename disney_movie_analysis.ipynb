    "## Question(s) of Interests\n",
    "In this analysis, I will be investigating few questions associated with the collection of disney movie datasets. I am interested in finding to what extend key factors like the movie release month, genre, rating, and the movie director have had influence on the overall box office success of disney movies over the years. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am interested in exploring these questions as it important to understand what factors influences audience to watch disney movies, and how has audiences' interests evolved over the years. I would expect release month would not have too much of an impact, unless it's during public holiday months. Since disney movies are released across the world, and each country has public holidays during different months, it should not have a significant impact on the box office. I am expecting comedy genres, and PG rated movies to have greater earnings as it would reach to a larger audience across the world. \n",

    "## Summary of Findings\n",
    "Earlier, we did analysis to find to what extend key factors like the movie release month, genre, rating, and the movie director have had influence on the overall box office success of disney movies over the years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 shows as expected, there is no clear relationship between when the movie is released (month) and its gross earnings. Disney movies are popular watch all year round. \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 shows Disney movies have gained nearly exponential popularity (or earnings) over the years. As seen in the figure, prior to 1985 not many Disney movies were released. Most movies were released from mid 1980s to early 2000s, but Disney movie earning grew the most (nearly doubled) post 2010. \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3 shows majority of the Disney movies have been comedy, and adventure (close-second). As expected, these genres are also higher earners than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 4 shows nearly 35% of movies have been rated PG, and this rating has been the highest earner. This is aligned with my earlier expectation as PG movies can be viewed by larger and more diverse audience. PG-13 movies are the second highest earners, and the second most popular Disney movie category. \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 5 shows the most popular Disney movie director has been Will Finn, and then Ron Clements with accumulated movie earnings of ~$950 M and ~$850 M, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the data analysis shows the most popular directors, genre, and ratings trend with higher movie earnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Impact of Findings and conluding remarks\n",
    "Disney movie exploratory analysis shows genres and ratings that have been most popular over the years. It provides insight into what sorts of movies audience enjoys watching. It provides opportunity to make similar themed movies for future. By knowing popular movie directors, future producers and directors can take inspiration from their films regarding techniques, characters, plot development as it has proven to appeal to wide range of audience. Because Disney movies have been earning the greatest amount in recent years, it shows that our audience today is still very engaged and invested with Disney, and that there is a huge market still waiting to be captured. For a movie marketing team, it also helps to understand a new Disney movie launch month will not have a significant impact on its overall revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, Disney movie genre, rating and movie director will have an influence on success of a disney movie. Other questions that I would be interested in answering includes which character or movies have been the most popular that it's worth making a sequel for, or how can we better commericalize less successful disney movies by re-making them to fit popular characterization, genre and rating. I would also be interested to know how has audience age-group changed over the years. \n"
